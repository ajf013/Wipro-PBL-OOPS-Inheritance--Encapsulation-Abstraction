 CCreate a class called Author is designed as follows:

It contains:
‚Ä¢ Three private instance variables: name (String), email (String), and gender (char of either ‚Äòm‚Äô or ‚Äòf‚Äô).
‚Ä¢ One constructor to initialize the name, email and gender with the given values.

And, a class called Book is designed as follows:
It contains:
‚Ä¢ Four private instance variables: name (String), author (of the class Author you have just created), price (double), and qtyInStock (int). Assuming that each book is written by one author.
‚Ä¢ One constructor which constructs an instance with the values given.
‚Ä¢ Getters and setters: getName(), getAuthor(), getPrice(), setPrice(), getQtyInStock(), setQtyInStock(). Again there is no setter for name and author.
Write the class Book (which uses the Author class written earlier). 
Try:
1. Printing the book name, price and qtyInStock from a Book instance. (Hint: aBook.getName())
2. After obtaining the ‚ÄúAuthor‚Äù object, print the Author (name, email & gender) of the book.
